Let me first say that it was a great delight to read this book.
While I read it maybe not in the most advisable way, that is from cover to cover, it was still a very interesting read.
It retrospect it might have been better, as actually also advised by the authors, to read the last chapter first.

O'Reilly's "Machine Learning Design Pattern" is an interesting collection of various design patter.
Each pattern comes with some code examples, pro and cons, as well as some alternatives.
Overall, the authors try to hit a similar mark as the famous [Design Pattern: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/).
While I am personally a bit sceptical that this book will gain the same traction and spread as its famous cousin, I believe this book is an important step in the right direction.
That is to finally put a name to many commonly used strategies in machine learning and data science.

In this particular regard, the book is a great success. 
With each pattern I felt a sign of relieve to finally have a name for something I have been doing for years. 
Alone for this reason I feel this book was worth the read.
Furthermore, there were also one or two pattern I didn't know before which made the book so much more delightful.

However, there were also a few things I didn't like about the book.
In particular, since the authors all come out of Google,  the focus on google related products such as tensorflow and BigQuery is sometimes too prominent.
While I do realize that the author needed to pick some framework to demonstrate those patterns, it would have been nice to show a little bit more variety.
This slight over reliance is also the main reason why I feel that it won't find the wide adoption as the corresponding object-oriented software pattern.

Another issue might be the field of machine learning itself.
Given the fast development and rapid changes we see in the field I am not entirely convinced that these patterns will survive the test of time.
Other pattern might replace those outlined in the book or bunch of entirely new once might emerge in the near future.
Actually, the authors seem very aware of this problem (see a recent [interview with Sara Robinson](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/mlopscommunity/machine-learning-design-8JXbTtYB9Of/)).

I really enjoyed this book and I think its an excellent book to have.
After finish reading it back to back I found myself going back to it multiple times during my work day.
And there I think lays the real power of this book.
It provides a quick way check up on different machine learning patterns when confronting a new data science problem or when one is re-visiting an existing solution as well as a shared vocabulary to talk about these pattern with your colleagues.
