Introduction
============

Open-Source is an approach to how software is licensed and created,
allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and improve the underlying source
code {% cite perens1999 %}. Open-Source Software (OSS) originated first within
universities when software was freely distributed among scientists
during the early 1950s {% cite dibona1999 %}. This approach stands in contrast
to proprietary software development, whose source code is only available
to the organization which owns the underlying intellectual properties
{% cite scott2003 %}. OSS was first formalized by Richard Stallman in 1984 as
Free Software under the GNU Project, aimed to provide a licensing
framework for software created to be freely distributed {% cite perens1999 %}.
The Free Software Foundation later adopted this definition as the
specification for what is now commonly referred to as open-source
software {% cite debianfoundation2023 %}.
